## WHY COLLECT DATA ON STREETLIGHTS?

 Smart streetlights are at the front lines of the smart city; the switch from traditional high pressure sodium street lights to LEDs is a proven cost saver for cities that can help to finance smart infrastructure. And during this switch the new light poles become part of the Internet of Things: valuable real estate for hanging cameras, sensors, wireless antennas and more. Street lights also sit in a public right-of-way, a space that often comes with some precedent of public-private collaboration, meaning that private sector companies and entrepreneurs developing smart city applications can deploy technology on existing infrastructure. 

## THE SOLUTION:

This project is intended to make information about how are street lights across the greater Kansas City metro area are used more transparent and accessible.The Streetlight Data project is an effort to create an aggregated database of streetlights in Kansas City and an online portal for city officials, residents and private sector partners to understand how this critical resource is being leveraged now and how it can better leveraged going forward.

## Data discovery: 
We are working with cities and other streetlight owners to understand first what data they currently collect, how it is stored, and what is available to share.
## Data integration: 
We are building a back-end database to store data from multiple sources, preserve privacy and security where necessary, and develop a database maintenance approach.
## Data visualization: 
We are creating a front-end portal to make these data useful to cities, partners, planners, and residents alike.

## APPROACH AND TIMELINE

The Streetlights project meets every Monday for Hack Nights at Think Big Partners from 6-8 pm. The team is currently in need of designers, researchers / reporters and anyone who wants to join! 

## These are the tasks for the foreseeable future
1. Loading the pole data into the (json) API
2. Loading the metadata into the api
3. API support and design work
4. UI for the API
